# Wrangle_OSM_Data
Curitiba is one of Brazil's Capital, located in the south area and for this reason has a colder climate. I do not know this City, but I always wanted to live there. To understand a little bit more about this City by taking a look into its dataset would be interesting.

This project was developed during the **Data Analyst Nanodegree** course from [**Udacity**](http://udacity.com/) and it used [**Open Street Map**](https://www.openstreetmap.org/) data.
